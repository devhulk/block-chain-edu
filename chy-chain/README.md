## Chy-Chain 

chy-chain is a block-chain implementation that includes the following...

# Transactions
One of the most common way to use block-chain is through e-currency ie(Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, etc). So thats what this particular implementation focuses on. One of the key concepts that facilitates the transfer of money is the ability to have a transaction between you and someone else. In order to use the block-chain to facilitate this transaction, instead of a bank, you need a "wallet" and that wallet must be secure.

There is some work around facilitating transactions utilizing the chain but we will get more into that later when I show you how to use it and set up your own private block-chain.

# Transaction Pool
The transaction pool is a vital concept to learn when talking about block-chain. This covers where transactions sit while "nodes" or computers that are a part of the block-chain compete to solve the hashing algorithm in order to take from this pool and add it to the blockchain.

# Mining
As mentioned above these nodes compete to solve a hashing algorithm. This algorithm is difficult to solve and thus takes real processing power, which translates to real energy, to solve. This is a critical concept within block-chain and one that has the most press. You always hear about people mining bitcoin or whatever currency. All that means is they have a souped up computer or ASIC board (more on this later) that is focused on solving that algorithm. Once the algorithm is solved the "miner" recieves a reward, that reward being a specified amount of currency.
